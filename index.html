            <h1>A short story I wrote for class</h1>
            <h2>Nora’s Journey</h2>
            <p>Nora walks through the forest with purpose.  The woman of average height with bright blue eyes and short golden hair is prepared to be on the road for awhile; on her back is a bag with a tent and bedroll, rations for close to a month, firestarter and dagger, and a two handed sword only a foot shorter than her.  She is going to find the Demon King and avenge the death of her teacher, the one who initially taught her how to use a sword, and all the other heroes that were sent out.  She will complete her task and return.</p>
            <p>The town sends out a hero to fend off the demons and prevent them from attacking the town.  If the town takes too long to send out a new hero, the raids start.  Nora walks onward as she recalls three times that the demons attacked the town.  There was a lot of arguing among the town leaders preceding the attack two years ago, at which point her teacher was chosen.  A few days ago, it was announced that she had been killed.  Nora remembers the shocked expressions on the faces of everyone upon her volunteering to go.</p>
            <p>How did they know that her instructor had died?  Some crystal ball thing, they tried to show it to her but Nora did not care.  She had made a choice and she was going to see it through.  Walking with care through the forest, she doesn’t want to return early with a sprained ankle, Nora enters the clearing that holds the portal to the world of demons.</p>
            <p>Standing alone in the center of the large clearing is a weird massive arch.  It is made up of unnaturally white blocks of stone floating above each other with intricate designs all over them in glowing red lines.  In the space of the arch and between the stones swirls a myriad of colors, predominantly pink but also purples and yellows and blues and oranges, so that one cannot see through to the other side.  From the arch is a well worn path that leads off to the side.</p>
            <p>Nora stood before the portal, awed and frightened by it.  She had often spent days and nights wandering by herself or with friends, but was strictly forbidden from going in this direction.  It was so massive, Nora wonders how she had not seen it before.  Nora spends a minute to steel herself, taking a few deep breaths, before stepping forward and through the arch.  Swallowed up by the colors, never to be seen on this side again.</p><br class="mobile-first">


            <p>A woman with long black hair, two small pointed horns on her forehead, wearing very little in the way of clothing, and radiating an aura of irresistible beauty walks through the forest alone.  She looks around with piercing black eyes.</p>
            <p>“I’m so hungry.”  she moans while licking her fingers.  <i>I haven’t had good food in over a week, just the standard fare.  Humans are simply the best, but fresh ones are so rare.  Hell, I might settle for an imp around now.  I haven’t been able to enjoy the taste of regular food in so long.  I can’t raise an army on an empty stomach.  Hmm?</i></p>
            <p>Her pointed ears perk at the sound of someone nearby, possibly setting up a camp?  She goes off the trail towards it, coming to the edge of a small clearing to see the back of a woman with short blond hair pulling something out of a bag on the other side of a campfire.  She hides behind a tree to watch.</p>
            <p>The black haired beauty starts to drool as she watches the blond woman setting up the tent.  Ignoring a sense of familiarity and undressing her with her imagination.  The way the plain skin will feel without fur or scales or feathers.  How the muscles will give way with a simple push.  The naive, ignorant, and scared voice as it asks for comfort.  The taste of the life as it is sucked out of her.</p>
            <p>The barely clothed beauty tussles up her hair a bit before walking forward and into the clearing, being sure to accentuate her hips.  “Excuse me,” the blond woman freezes mid tent setup, still with her back to the black haired stranger.  “I haven’t had anything to eat for a while, would you happen to have anything to share?”  The woman by the tent takes a second before standing up and moving over to her bag.  <i>Something about her seems, familiar.  Who is… wait!</i></p>
            <p>The horned woman’s thoughts are cut short as she hears the sound of a sword sliding out of its sheath and the blond woman charging her with killing intent.</p>
            <p>“Wait, no.  Nor-”</p>
            <p>She is silenced by a diagonal cut, trying to parry with a weapon she does not have.</p><br class="mobile-first">


            <p>A tall monster nearly covered in white scales wanders through a thick fog.  Bipedal and standing close to seven feet tall, she carefully steps through the forest brush with reptilian feet.  Hair is long, wiry, white, and also growing from her back down the spine to the base of a thick tail.  Her face and torso are the only parts that have human skin and features.  The only color on the white monstrosity are mud colored rags and glaring blue eyes.</p>
            <p>She pauses and looks around.  She can tell that this fog is magic, powerful magic, and is calling to her, but not more than that.  Does this occur naturally?  Did something create this?  Annoyed with a lack of answers, she starts to move again.</p>
            <p>A clawed hand pushes a low-hanging branch out of the way, to suddenly find the edge of the fog.  A campsite is encircled by this thick fog.  The monster’s eyes meets those of a shorter blond woman about to take another bite from a cooked forest creature.  The monster stares calmly as the woman quickly gets over her surprise, scrambling to stand and draw a large sword at her side.  Arms shaking, but sword held still.  The monster’s eyes stay locked with the woman’s, both the same blue.</p>
            <p>The monster lets out a defeated sigh, shoulders dropping a bit.  Giving one last look to the woman, the monster turns around trudges back through the fog.  The firm forest floor quickly turns into a soft swamp, and soon the monster is out of the fog.  She turns to glare at the fog as it dissipates completely, leaving her in the middle of a swamp.  Clawed hands clenched into fists.</p>
            <p>“rrrrRRAAAAA!!!”  <i><b>CRACK!!</b></i></p>
            <p>The monster stomps off away from the area, leaving a hole in the tree unfortunate enough to have been next to her.</p><br class="mobile-first">


            <p>“Hey Grick, is that the new one that came through two weeks ago?”</p>
            <p>“Looks like it, Ytro.  Blond with some muscles.  Looks like her hair is losing some color, though.  Shame they were quick to send a new one this time.”</p>
            <p>Grick and Ytro, two short impish looking creatures with reddish skin and one horn each, walked with silent footsteps into the campsite with a single occupant.  She is still sleeping, as the sun has barely risen over the horizon.  Grick to the bag and Ytro to the blond woman.</p>
            <p>Grick glances to the sword before opening the bag.  “That’s a big sword she’s got, wonder how much the centaurs will buy it for.”</p>
            <p>“That implies the centaurs will even deal with us.”  Ytro replies.  Grick hears him slash open the bedroll with his short sword and push the blond woman onto her back.  “Not that impressive a rack, but hey, can’t win them all.”  Grick starts to pull out items as he senses Ytro gathering up his magic to cast a spell.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, Grick hears a “Grck”, <i><b>SLAM</b></i>, shluk.  He spins around to see Ytro laying inside the tent with his torso slashed open and the blond woman climbing out with Ytro’s sword in hand dripping with blood.  <i>Idiot had to make a show about it.</i>  Grick makes a quick gesture towards the woman as she stands, sending out his magic.  She lets out a surprised gasp as her legs quiver and give out and her face flushes red.</p>
            <p>Grick swaggers forward, hand still outwards intensifying the magic.  “Hehe, you may as well give in now.  It will feel <i>so</i> much better when you do.”</p>
            <p>The woman gives Grick a glare that sends shivers down his spine.  Before he can react, she springs her hand forward and embeds the sword upwards into his chest to the hilt.  As darkness closes in on him, he hears her pant out “Go to hell.”</p><br class="mobile-first">


            <p>The communal food tent in the centaur town of Shattered Spear is as noisy as ever, and the centauress Ironblood just wants to be alone.  Unfortunately for her, her friend had gotten wind of something she had tried earlier.</p>
            <p>“Did he really dump you after just one day?  How many has it been now?  You might have better chances if you weren’t so scary in sparring and bed.”</p>
            <p>Ironblood brushes her brown hair out of the way and continues eating her dinner, trying to ignore her talkative friend.  <i>Will she just shut up about it, already.  Well, she knows how I’m going to get back at her.  Everyone else is getting with someone, why not me?</i></p>
            <p>“You know, at this rate, you won’t find anyone to stay with you.”</p>
            <p>Ironblood slams the table, standing up on her front hooves.  “HEY, at least I’m asking.  How long have you had your crush and refused to speak up?”</p>
            <p>Ironblood got some joy out of the flustered look on her friend’s face.  “I, uh, I’m waiting, for the right, look, we’re not talking about me, here.  You know it’s okay to ask for help with something.”</p>
            <p>“Pfah, I don’t need the help of a coward.  Cuz you know what, next one that enters the dining area I will go over and successfully spend the night with.”  Ironblood sits back down to continue eating her food.</p>
            <p>“Assuming it’s one you haven’t asked yet, it’s a bet.”  She eagerly starts to scan the crowd.</p>
            <p>“Assuming it’s one I haven’t, shut up.”</p>
            <p>“Is that a human?”</p>
            <p>Ironblood, and others that heard, look up from their food to see human woman dazedly staggering into the dining area.  She looks to be about a bit over half of Ironblood’s standing head-height, with medium length white hair, carrying a bag full of travelling supplies, a large two handed sword of decent make, and two crude imp short swords.  The centaurs nearby are giving her room, but otherwise ignoring her.</p>
            <p>“I think the last time we saw a human was four years ago?  The demons were celebrating about something around two years ago.”</p>
            <p>“Did she have an encounter with imps?”  Ironblood mutters while putting her utensils down to watch the woman stumble forward, catching herself on a pole and breathing heavily.  Ironblood stands up on all four hooves and starts to leave the table.</p>
            <p>“Where are you going?”  Her friend asks through a mouthful of salad.  “I’ll have your food, you know.”  </p>
            <p>“She’s still feeling the effects of an imp encounter and the healer’s tent is in the opposite direction.  Besides, I don’t back down from bets.”</p>
            <p>A stupid grin spreads across her face.  “Eeeehhhh.  Have fun.  Be sure to be awake in time to take over my guard shift.”  She then dives into her food and drags Ironblood’s plate over.
            <p>Ironblood keeps her eye on the strange woman while walking down the table aisle.  The woman starts moving again, though even more unsure on her feet.  As the woman is starting to stumble, Ironblood has positioned herself in front of her.  The woman bumps into her horse body between the front and back hooves and grabs onto the brown furred body.</p>
            <p>“Are you feeling okay?”</p>
            <p>“So… hot… “</p>
            <p>“Imps can have that effect, it’s usually long lasting unless relieved.  I can help you, but not here.  Can you walk?  Or … ” Ironblood hesitated before continuing.  <i>I think you are light enough that I can lift you.</i>  “Would you rather be carried?”</p>
            <p>The white haired woman looks up and down Ironblood’s horse body, possibly not noticing the human looking part, before climbing up onto her with ease and practice.</p>
            <p>“Ah, what are you, umm… “ Ironblood blushes and takes a moment to collect herself, noticing others nearby giggling and her friend struggling to not choke on her food.  <i>I hope you do choke on it, you nag.</i>  “I’m going to start moving now, do try to hold on.”  Ironblood moves forward, determined to not let the reactions of others bother her.  The woman is light, compared to the armor Ironblood is used to wearing, and stays on easily.  Ironblood takes a path behind the sleeping tents to the tent she shares with her friend to avoid unnecessary looks.</p>
            <p>Ironblood pulls aside the flap to her shared tent and walks in.  The inside is symmetrical to either side; two straw beds, two short table structures with a pillow, two armor and weapon racks with their personal equipment on it, two crates for personal belongings, and a map of a great portion of the land between the armor racks.  Barely enough room for two centaurs to move around in together.</p>
            <p>The centauress walks over to the bed on the left side and sits down facing the table.  Twisting around, she hefts the panting woman off her back and sits her on the table.  The woman is observing Ironblood’s face while the centauress is removing the swords and putting them to the side.  Leaning forward as Ironblood is removing the traveling bag, the woman mutters “Pretty...”</p>
            <p>“What was -?” Ironblood is interrupted by the woman’s arms, once freed from the backpack, being flung forward and pulling her into a deep kiss.  The backpack drops to the ground behind the table with a thud.</p>
            <p>Ironblood is not taken by surprise again throughout the night.</p>
            <p>Ironblood wakes up to find her nighttime companion gone without a trace.  Looking around, she vaguely notes that her friend’s armor and weapon rack is empty and the map is gone.  Stretching, she gets up fully and puts a clean light shirt on from her crate before heading out for breakfast.  Ironblood is grateful that there aren’t many in the dining area this early and can eat her food in silence, though the cook minding the stew does give her a weird smirk.</p>
            <p>With breakfast done with, Ironblood trots to her tent to put on her armor and start her watch at the gate.  Her friend is still standing, leaning on a halberd, when she arrives.</p>
            <p>“Hey, where did the human from last night go?”</p>
            <p>Her friend looks at her and gives another of her stupid grins.  “Human?  What human?  There was no human here at all yesterday.  I also definitely didn’t see a human run out early in the morning and dive into the river.”  Her friend turns toward the river with a puzzled look.  “I think she had a tail when she came out the other side.”</p><br class="mobile-first">


            <p>“DAAAD!!”</p>
            <p>“YEAH?”</p>
            <p>“THEY’RE BACK AGAIN.”</p>
            <p>‘They’ needed no explanation.  The bipedal canine sighs and looks up from the small plot of earth next to his large house he was digging at with a spade.  His workers started to move as soon as they heard, some to the fence spreading out from the house and others to the barn and coops and pens.  The farm owner stands up and enters the house.  Making his way to the front and leaving the spade on a table, he learned not to bring anything out when dealing with Them.</p>
            <p>The farm owner reaches the front door to find his young son standing in the doorway glaring at the unwanted visitors.  They number five in total, each one giving his son a lecherous look.</p>
            <p><i>There’s no war-demon among them, they don’t mean to actually destroy anything.</i>  The farm owner places his hand on his son’s shoulder, who steps aside and goes through the house and out the back.  The farm owner takes his son’s place in the doorway glaring at the demons who have turned their looks to him.  “Well?  What do ya’ll want?  We already gave our tithes to you thieves.”</p>
            <p>The middle demon, a tall figure with horns only adding more to his height, spreads two muscled arms wide while keeping another two crossed.  “Indeed you did.  And you are thanked for your, generous, offering.  We have good news, though.  We are holding a feast tomorrow and require more food to feed the mouths there.”</p>
            <p>“And why should we care about what we won’t attend?”</p>
            <p>A childlike demon to the leader’s right with flaming red hair, the farm owner suspects she’s more than twice his age, pipes up showing off a mouth with far too many teeth in it.  “The landlord will be in attendance at this feast.  I’m sure you’ll want to give her a good impression.  If it’s good enough, she may even grace your shithole with a visit.”  The rest of the demons smirked and giggled at that.</p>
            <p>The farm owner growls in response.  “Oh yeah?  And how much are you asking for anyway?  Enough to feed 50?”  Not taking his eyes off of the leader.</p>
            <p>The leader makes a big show of counting each of the fingers on his hands.  “One… hundred… seventy three.  And a half.  At least.  I’m sure you can handle that.”</p>
            <p>The farm owner steps back to slam the door.  “Fuck off back to hell where you-”</p>
            <p>“Hey, wasn’t there a large bandit party nearby?”  The far right ugly demon leans over to ask the far left uglier demon loudly.  The farm owner pauses, eyes still on the leader.</p>
            <p>“Yeah, that’s what I heard too.  Man, they are always so difficult to control.  If only the landlord was appeased, she could -” the far left demon does not get to finish her sentence, as her head is sent flying.  A human woman with wiry white hair of medium length and a thick white scaled tail had managed to sneak up on all of them.  The farm owner can only blankly stare at her face contorted with rage.</p>
            <p>The other demons are not given any time to react.  “geeAARRGGG!!”  The woman brings her large sword down and through an upper shoulder of the leader into the side of the left demon.  Pulling the sword out, she shoves the leader demon onto the far right demon as the childlike one dashes forward and chomps onto her right ankle.</p>
            <p>She winces into a grimace as she swings her foot up and slams it into the demon's stomach, “gkhuh!”  The woman pivots forward on her right foot, stabbing the leader through the chest and into the other demon.  She twists the sword and pulls it out, the two demons collapsing to the side.  The farm owner’s jaw starts working again as she is giving the coup de grâce to the last two demons.</p>
            <p>“Um, thank you.”  The farm owner speaks up and the woman whips around and stares at him, noticing him for the first time.  She backs away a couple steps, eyes darting all over, before turning and hightailing it into the nearby forest.</p>
            <p>“Hey, WAIT!”  The farm owner follows, but trips over a lump leaning against one of the first trees.  Recognizing the bag, he goes over to examine it to find food from his farm stuffed into it.  He gives out an annoyed sigh.</p>
            <p>“If you were going to steal something, you may as well take it with you.”</p><br class="mobile-first">


            <p><i>Closer.  Come closer, little one.</i></p>
            <p>The Demon King sits on his throne shrouded in darkness, a shell of his former self.  He was once the most feared being in the realm, even the Archpriest of the planet’s Deity still cowers in hiding.  All of the powerful mages have been subjugated to his will, killed for defying his will, or hiding from his will.  His powers were once mighty, but they have been drained from him, going somewhere he knows not.  Of the many skulls that decorate his glorious mane, only two still glow with power.  Now, no one willingly served him.</p>
            <p><i>Just a bit further now.</i></p>
            <p>His castle stands by itself on a hill, surrounded by vegetation either dying or a hideous copy of their former selves.  The major river of the land starts at his castle, and runs an oozing purple.  Less than an hour ago, a stranger braved the wild brush surrounding the castle and snuck in.  The Demon King smirks in excitement as he watches her.</p>
            <p>The Demon King pays no mind to the activities of his portals, but this one piqued his interest.  He had been watching the Archpriest’s hiding place, waiting for an opportunity to strike, when the Archpriest actually looked out.  He had been quick to strike, draining two of his subjugated mages dry, but had failed to land a solid blow.  Turning his gaze to what the Archpriest was looking at, he found a human woman standing near a campsite with a large sword in hand.  As he continued to watch her, she did not stay human long.  The transformations she went through show a personality similar to the white dragon; prideful, stubborn, and headstrong.</p>
            <p><i>And completely out of your element, in this world.</i></p>
            <p>She also proved to have annoying tendencies in line as some kind of hero.  Killing demons as she finds them, being the catalyst of yet another centaur rebellion, interfering with tax collection, helping out lost stray puppies, and sneaking through his castle intent to kill.</p>
            <p>The door to the throne room is kicked open, and the Demon King smirks and stands.  Before him is a hopeless and lost lizard.  He steps forward on two hooved feet as he greets his guest.  “Welcome to my castle, little lizard.  I hope you find it to your liking?”</p>
            <p>The lizard grips her large sword with both clawed hands and charges forward with an, amusing, battlecry.  The Demon King simply chuckles, opens a spindly hand in front of him and raises it up.  The very floor responds, rising up and grabbing her arms, stopping her in her tracks.  She struggles to free them as the Demon King steps closer.  “Come now, little lizard.  There is no need for this hostility.”</p>
            <p>The Demon King is met with a fierce glare.  “I am not a lizard, I am a human!”</p>
            <p>He raises a thick eyebrow.  “Does a human have a succulent tail?  Or white scales and claws for hands?  Or such white hair?”</p>
            <p>“All tricks!  Lies!”</p>
            <p>“Oh come now, a Demon King never lies.  But if you don’t believe my words, will you believe your eyes?”  The Demon King snaps his fingers.  A mirror the size of the Demon King slides up from the floor, towering over the lizard.  She stops her struggling to look into the mirror.  Eyes are wide with shock as she looks from the top of her wiry white hair, to the clawed hands holding the sword, following the line of the tail as it droops down a bit.</p>
            <p>She shuts her eyes and struggles to free her arms again.  “You seek to fool me with your mirror?  With it’s tainted image?  I will NOT be fooled by your tricks!”  The Demon King grin grows wider.</p>
            <p>“You hurt me, little lizard.  I told you, a Demon King never lies.  I assure you, this is a regular mirror.  Why are you here anyway?  Money?  Revenge?  Power?”  The Demon King circles the trapped lizard, hooves clopping on the stone floor.</p>
            <p>“I’m here to kill you and end your reign of terror!”  She has stopped trying to twist her way out, and is instead trying to pull her arms out.</p>
            <p>“Yes, yes, those are all nice and general reasons.  Why do YOU!”  The Demon King gives the lizard a hard poke, causing her to stumble in her restraints.  “Want to kill me so badly?”</p>
            <p>She takes a moment to get her clawed feet under her before responding.  “For killing my teacher.  Her, and all the others you have slain!”</p>
            <p>“Hmm.”  The Demon King stands upright, arms crossed.  “It pains me to admit, but you are the first person to come to me in… 15 years?”</p>
            <p>“What … “</p>
            <p>“It’s true.  I have been, <b>so</b>, lonely all these years.  Ah, but I may be able to reunite you with your teacher.”</p>
            <p>The lizard mutters softly, “no”.</p>
            <p>“It is likely that she wasn’t killed when she entered this world, just picked up by my demons.  If she’s still alive, I can easily get you to meet again.”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“Your teacher would be having the time of her life, enjoying herself and others.  All you have to do is join me, join us, and you can see her again."  The Demon King pauses his circling to look over the little lizard.  "Your village won’t accept you as you are now, anyway.  You may as well become something here.”  The Demon King holds out his spindly hand as he releases the stone floor’s grip with the other.</p>
            <p>“NooOOOOO!!!!”  The lizard swings her sword around.  The Demon King dodges backwards, but not before hit outstretched hand is sliced off and part of his mane cut off.  Five skulls shatter as they hit the floor and the lizard continues her attack.  “LIES!!!”  His stomach is opened, thighs are cut.  “LIES!!”  Ribs caved in, shoulders broken.  “LIES!”  Head carved through, and his body turns to ash before another blow could land.  Sword striking the stone floor through it.</p>
            <p>Tear drops fall to the floor.  “Lies…“</p><br class="mobile-first">


            <p>Nora walks along the bank of the river, the Demon King’s castle far behind her.  She walks slowly, not really seeing where she going.  The river bends towards her and her foot steps into the water.  Her clawed foot.  Both legs are covered in white scales and end in clawed, reptilian feet.  The remains of her boots still wraps around them.  </p>
            <p>Nora drops her bag and turns to the water.  It is clear and running fast.  She drops to her knees and extends her hands down into it.  Pausing as she watches the water flow past her clawed hands and not washing it away.  She scoops water up in both hands and splashes her face with it.  Nora looks down at the water, seeing her reflection.  A human like face, with wiry white hair reaching past her shoulders and lizard like eyes, stares back up at her.  She reaches up to touch her hair, and the figure in the water does the same.</p>
            <p>She looks behind her suddenly to see a white scaled tail, connected to her, touching her bag.  She reaches a shaking hand behind her to the tail, recoiling slightly at the touch of it.  She goes to touch it again, and again, slowly getting used to the new appendage growing out of her.</p>
            <p>Nora turns to face the river again, hugging her knees tight to her chest.  Her thoughts turn to the village she left long ago.  Hiding her face in her arms, the tears flow freely.</p>
            <p>The Demon King was right, her village will not accept her again.</p>
